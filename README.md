# 🏠 Estate Tokens – Tokenizing Real-World Assets on EVM

Estate Tokens is a decentralized platform that enables tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs), allowing users to mint fractional ownership tokens (shares) of real estate properties across the globe.

Our mission: **Make global real-estate investing accessible, transparent, and permissionless.**

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**
   Users connect their Metamask wallet to the platform.

2. **Complete KYC Verification**
   Users upload KYC details and submit them for verification.

3. **Buy Property Shares**
   Once verified, users can mint estate tokens (fractional shares) of verified properties and later sell them for potential profit.

### **1. Solidity Contract**

The Estate Token smart contract is written in **Solidity using Hardhat**, fully tested and audited.

📌 **Deployed on Base-sepolia:**

### **2. Frontend**

Built with:

- **React / Next.js**
- **Wagmi Wallet Adapter**
- **Viem**
- **x402-fetch/express** for streamlined payment execution

#### ▶️ Run the frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### **3. Backend**

The backend integrates the x402 protocol, enabling:

- Secure transaction processing
- Payment validations
- Transaction status confirmation before minting tokens
- Mint's shares to user's account using deployer's private key.
